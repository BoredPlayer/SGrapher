## 1. Installation
To install the software, user can choose one of the two recommended paths:
1. Cloning with git
2. Manually downloading files

However, SGrapher is highly dependant on python and some python libraries. In order to correctly install full package, please follow instructions from [Dependencies](#11-dependencies) section.

### 1.1. Dependencies
In order to work correctly, SGrapher needs:
1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpreter
2. [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - highly advanced math library
3. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/index.html#installation-quick-start) - a powerful plotting library
4. [matgrapher](https://github.com/BoredPlayer/matgrapher) - a simple matplotlib wraper for better code readability
5. [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) - a library aiding GUI creation

Please install all of the above before downloading SGrapher.

### 1.2. Git clone

Due to the project being in early phase of development, it will receive updates fairly often. Therefore, cloning may be a better option, as it makes it much easier to download the newest version of the software.

3. Go to your desired folder (for example `cd Documents/git/`)
4. Execute command `git clone https://github.com/BoredPlayer/SGrapher.git`

After these steps SGrapher should be installed on your computer.

### 1.3. Manual download

If you do not wish to have all of the repository's history stored on your computer, you may choose downloading a zip file containing all of the files. In order to do it:
